            Even the oldest annals recognize the ancient kingdom of the reptilian Xxcha as the first of the great interstellar civilizations.
          Nestled in the middle of a wealthy section of space, the Xxcha twin planets of Archon Ren and Archon Tau lie bathed in the gentle light of the Xxlak star.
          While the Xxcha still call the two planets "twins," an outsider will instantly notice that the grayish and shadowy Archon Tau in no way resembles the brilliant, healthy green of Archon Ren.
          <br></br>
            Throughout the tenure of the los Lazax Imperium, the Xxcha were the most peaceful, docile, and content of the major civilizations.  They did not, unlike the other races, scheme for power
          and territory during the Age of Dusk.  Unlike the Lazax, the Xxcha elders did see the growing threat to the galaxy.  They fruitlessly sought to warn the Lazax of their peril, and struggled
          to bring dialogue to the increasing racial factionalism.  A powerful Lazax councilor by the name of Ibna Vel Syd listened to the Xxcha warning, but even he could not sway the false sense
          of safety felt by the emperor.  Then, disaster struck.  The Quann crisis erupted into sudden war, and the Letnev, led by the Baron Daz Arrokan I, moved towards the rich Xxcha system in conquest.
          The Xxcha, unprepared and weaponless, used their formidable powers of negotiation and goodwill to broker an agreement in which they ceded only Archon Tau to the invaders, while the kingdom
          retained a Letnev-supervised autonomy on Archon Ren.  The Xxcha, never fools, were aware of the nature of Letnev promises and the futility of the agreement.  The agreement would only last
          as long as the Barony was occupied in war elswhere.  In time, the Xxcha knew, the Letnev would return to claim the rest of their prize and enslave them.  It was then, for the first time in
          their history, that the Xxcha started to create their first weapons and train their first armies.  In secret deep groves and in hidden vales, the Xxcha king sadly watched his people develop
          into warriors.
          <br></br>
            Less than a decade after the occupation of Archon Tau, the Letnev fleet suffered a stunning defeat against Sol in the Gral system.  Only a few cycles after the battle, the Sol Phoenix fleet
          entered the Xxlak system and engaged the heavily fortified Letnev positions on Archon Tau.  The ensuing bombardments and battles lasted for almost two years.  In the end, the Letnev occupiers
          were defeated, but with a terrible toll.  The ecology of Archon Tau had been shattered beyond recall.  What was once a true twin to the green, fruitful Archon Ren was now a noxious, blackened
          crater.  Its forests had burned.  Ashes and scattered dust started a planet-wide winter that lasted for a hundred years, killing most plant and animal life.

        <p class="right">
            Now, recovered from the loss of Archon Tau, the Xxcha kingdom has prospered on the generous Archon Ren.  Covered by mostly leafy forests, small inland oceans, and fruitful jungles, Archon
          Ren is rich in minerals, energy, and water.  The Xxcha civilization dwells in a myriad of arboreal villages and towns.  The only true metropolis is the giant city of Kklaj, found on the planet's
          southern hemisphere.  Kklaj functions as the seat of the Xxcha King, whose extensive palace, entirely sculpted of Q'waar wood, and flower gardens, stretch for miles at the center of the city.
          <br></br>
            The Xxcha are an inherently peaceful, slow, and thoughtful people.  They hold their nobles and town elders in deep respect.  A common pastime of Xxcha males and females alike is to debate
          meaning and origin while smoking gerr root on long-stemmed pipes.  The jungles and lakes of Archon Ren are surprisingly free from the invasive insects that so often make forest and jungle planets
          unbearable.
          <br></br>
            Although the Xxcha still believe in the doctrine of peace and negotiation, they will never again bend to foreign invasion.  Travelers to the Xxlak system will often notice impressive sentinel
          Xxcha superdreadnoughts and the distinctive Xxlun fighters in intense naval exercises.  Although the typical Xxcha may seem slow and encumbered by a heavy reptilian bodily weight, when roused,
          the Xxcha are surprisingly strong and fast.
          <br></br>
            The pale shadow of Archon Tau hangs like a scar in the Xxcha skies.  The sight of it is the everlasting sorrow of the Xxcha, and the ever-present reminder of the cost of submission.  The Xxcha
          will never allow such tragedy to befall them again.  Ccrysus, the Xxcha King, knows that for the sake of a peaceful galaxy, the Xxcha must seek the Imperial Throne and be wise for all.
